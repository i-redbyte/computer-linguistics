Linguistic experiments
===

I play with different linguistic algorithms without any specific purpose.

1. Add ```Levenshtein distance``` [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#:~:text=Informally%2C%20the%20Levenshtein%20distance%20between,considered%20this%20distance%20in%201965.)
2. Add ```Markov chains```algorithm [Link1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) [Link2](https://www.edureka.co/blog/introduction-to-markov-chains/#What%20Is%20A%20Transition%20Matrix)
